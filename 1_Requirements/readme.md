INTRODUCTION:
	     
       The mini-project “Smart Water Management System” is to detect the water level and automaticall turn on the pump to fill water in the tank if the water level is low.
       
FEATURE      :	

       Detect the water level using IOT and avoid wastage of water.

	 
COST          :

       Affordable cost and nowdays many people are use this method in very esay way.

SWOT ANALYSIS:
	     
       Strength      : Online detection and control using android Bluetooth app.
       
       Weakness      : Little difficult to further maintainance.
       
       Opportunities : Simplify the task of avoiding wastage of water in households as well as other sides like companies and industries also.
       
       Threat        :Sometimes the sensors getting overheated. 
	     
	     4 W's and 1H
	          
      who      : All the industries who has using large amount of water for manufacturing purpose,or any houses who use water daily .        
	    
      what     :     This project gives the opportunity for online detection and control ot water in the storage tank using android Bluetooth app. 
	    
      when     : As the manufacturing of the industry increases the water usage also gets increases. With the increases of water usage the proper level of water and its temprature requires.
	    
      where    : This problem is surfaced in all the industries and household in the world
	    
      How      : This project use some sensors, microcontroller and proper filteration unit and yields out the pure quality water.
