INTRODUCTION:
	     
       The mini-project “Smart Water Management System” is to detect the water level, leakage and also to filter the contaminated water and provide clean water via natural filters. 
       
FEATURE      :	

       Current temperature is sensed using temperature sensor, when temperature reaches 0 degree Celsius the  temperature. Leakage in the water tank is detected using moisture sensor. when any leakage is encountered notification is sent to mobile app and motor is switched OFF. A natural filtration setup is used to filter the contaminated water where the filtration unit was designed using natural resources such as activated carbon,  mineral balls, filter paper(polyester) and pebbles.

	 
COST          :

       Affordable cost and nowdays many people are use this method in very esay way.

SWOT ANALYSIS:
	     
       Strength      : Online detection and control using android Bluetooth app.
       Weakness      : Little difficult to further maintainance.
       Opportunities : Simplify the task of maintaining clean water and avoid wastage of water in households as well as other sides like companies and industries also.
       Threat        :Sometimes the sensors getting overheated. 
	     
	     4 W's and 1H
	          
      who      : All the industries who has using large amount of water for manufacturing purpose,or any houses who use water daily .        
	    what     : Combined facilities of water quality checking, leakage detection, contamination and pipe management is not available at present.     
	               This project gives the opportunity for online detection and control ot water in the storage tank using android Bluetooth app. 
	    when     : As the manufacturing of the industry increases the water usage also gets increases. With the increases of water usage the proper level of water and its temprature requires.
	    where    : This problem is surfaced in all the industries and household in the world
	    How      : This project use some sensors, microcontroller and proper filteration unit and yields out the pure quality water.
